# Fog of Pawn – RimWorld 1.6

Fog-of-Pawn obscures some details of newly-joined pawns so the player doesn't have perfect knowledge on day-one.  As the colony interacts with the pawn, the fog gradually lifts – creating emergent stories like *"I hired a doctor... turns out he can't even suture a scratch!"*

## Deception Tiers (v2)
1. **Truthful** – ~90 % of pawns (slider adjustable)  
   • All skills & passions reported accurately.
2. **Slightly-Deceived** – up to 3 random skills are exaggerated or understated.  
   • Passions can be faked for those skills.  
   • All other skills start fully revealed.
3. **Deceiver – Scammer**  
   • Low-value pawn (< 200 skill score) reports 8–12 in every low skill, faking competence.  
4. **Deceiver – Sleeper**  
   • High-value pawn (> 300 skill score) sandbags their elite skills, reporting 3–6 with no passions.

Deceiver tier is restricted to pawns that *join* the player (wanderers, refugees, quests) unless the toggle is disabled.

---
## Developer Utilities
* Dev-mode gizmos on each pawn:  
  • Print Deception Profile  
  • Set Tier → Truthful / Slight / Scammer / Sleeper (with pawn-value validation)  
  • +XP Shooting (forces reveal check)
* Console logs follow `[FogOfPawn REFLECT|FAIL|DEBUG|PROFILE]` tags – only in DevMode or with `VERBOSE_LOG` symbol.

## Build / Test
```
# Windows PowerShell
./build.ps1            # compile + sync DLL to ./1.6/Assemblies
```
Launch RimWorld with Dev mode on, spawn pawns, and use the gizmos or settings sliders to test.

## Roadmap (Next Milestones)
2. **Finish Sleeper / Scammer storyline**  
   • Multi-phase RulePack events (“Suspicion → Anomaly → Reveal”).  
   • Finalize exile / death mood impacts.  
4. **Polish & Release (M7)**  
   • Localization stubs for new strings.  
   • Compatibility passes (RIMHUD, Character Editor).  
   • Steam Workshop page.

Trait concealment patch – implemented (swap-during-draw + tooltip mask).

Full-Reveal System (WIP)
* **Sleeper – Combat activation**: accumulates *Sleeper combat XP* (slider, default 5000). On reaching the threshold or a lucky daily roll, the pawn is revealed.
* **Scammer – Caught learning**: when any skill below level 4 gains *Scammer low-skill XP* (slider, default 4000) the fraud is exposed.
* **Passive daily chance**: independent 0-20 % slider (default 1 %) for both archetypes.
* **Aftermath**
  • Scammer drops a *Disguise kit* (utility belt) – worn kits reduce displayed Market Value by the *Wealth reduction* slider (default 2000).  
  • Colonists gain a temporary –15 social opinion (“Betrayed by a fraud”).  
  • Colony mood bonus +5 for 5 days when a revealed Scammer dies or is exiled (to-do).
