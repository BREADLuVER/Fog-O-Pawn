  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text>On this day, colonists began noting subtle inconsistencies in {PAWN_nameDef}'s behavior—an upright stance, unusually sharp reflexes. Informal mealtime chatter has turned toward quiet speculation.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.1>{PAWN_nameDef} was heard humming a military march while hauling stone. No one else could place the melody.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.1>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.2>One colonist recorded that during a card game, {PAWN_nameDef} seemed to track hands without ever looking directly at the cards.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.2>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.3>It was observed that {PAWN_nameDef} sharpens knives with a technique more fitting of academy training than frontier life.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Suspicion.Text.3>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text>An unexpected crisis disrupted routine. Witnesses report that {PAWN_nameDef} responded with unnatural speed and tactical clarity, issuing orders that even veteran militia instinctively obeyed.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.1>During a solar flare, {PAWN_nameDef} bypassed power relays with unfamiliar efficiency, then dismissed the action as mere coincidence.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.1>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.2>Following a raid alarm, {PAWN_nameDef} was seen snapping into formation protocols not recognized by local defense staff.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.2>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.3>After a mis-thrown grenade landed nearby, {PAWN_nameDef} reacted instinctively—intercepting, returning it mid-roll—then cited 'muscle memory' as explanation.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Anomaly.Text.3>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text>With no further reason to maintain the illusion, {PAWN_nameDef} assumed a hardened posture and authoritative tone. Observers noted the shift immediately. Their former identity now reads like a discarded mask.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.1>After the incident, {PAWN_nameDef} stood motionless before stating, "Directive acknowledged." The room reportedly fell silent.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.1>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.2>Eyewitnesses recall {PAWN_nameDef} calmly reciting long strings of coordinates and oath phrases—none matching any known RimWorld factions.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.2>

  <Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.3>{PAWN_nameDef} exhaled once, drew their sidearm, and disengaged the safety without comment. All present understood something irreversible had occurred.</Fog_SleeperReveal_Revealed.Text.3>

  <Fog_SleeperChoice.Text>The facade has shattered. {PAWN_nameDef}—once just another survivor—now stands revealed as something far more dangerous… or perhaps, necessary. Their movements are sharper, their voice steadier, their eyes no longer darting with uncertainty. Training buried deep has surfaced, and they make no effort to deny it. Now, with the colony watching, {PAWN_nameDef} waits—ready for judgment, or a mission.</Fog_SleeperChoice.Text>

  <Fog_SleeperChoice.Text.2>The truth can't be hidden anymore. Every gesture, every decision, now makes sense in hindsight—{PAWN_nameDef} was never just a wanderer.

  <Fog_SleeperChoice.Text.3>They've worked beside you, bled for the colony, shared meals and storms. But now, {PAWN_nameDef} stands exposed—an agent of something else, once. Weapon… friend? The tension in the air is thicker than dust before a raid. They say nothing, but their stance is unflinching. The choice is yours: cast them out, or embrace the soldier hidden in plain sight.</Fog_SleeperChoice.Text.3>
