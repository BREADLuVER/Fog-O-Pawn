You are helping build a RimWorld mod called **"Fog of Pawn"**.

The goal of the mod is to obscure certain details of a pawn when they first join the colony. Instead of giving the player perfect knowledge (as in vanilla RimWorld), we add a fog layer to some pawn attributes and slowly reveal their true values based on player interaction, behavior, or time. This creates emergent storytelling moments (e.g., "I thought this guy was a doctor... turns out he's not").

We **do not mutate vanilla pawn data** ‚Äî we instead store *fogged* or *reported* values in a sidecar component (`CompPawnFog`). This allows game logic to use the real values, while the UI shows "reported" or "uncertain" info until discovery events occur.

## ‚úÖ Fog Rules

These pawn attributes are **fogged at spawn** and gradually revealed:

- **Skills**: Instead of exact values, we show "Reported: 6‚Äì10" or "Unknown". Real skill is revealed after 300 XP.
- **Passions**: May be fake or exaggerated. Real passion revealed when the associated skill is revealed.
- **Traits**: Problematic traits (e.g. Pyromaniac) are hidden. Reveal triggers include mental breaks or relevant actions.
- **Addictions**: Fully hidden unless the pawn consumes drugs or enters withdrawal.
- **Backstory Text**: Only title shown (e.g., "Drifter"). Full description is unlocked via social interaction or time (e.g. 7 days).

These details are **always visible**:
- Name, age range (not exact number), ideology, incapable work types, faction, backstory title.

## üé≤ Deception Randomization

Each pawn is assigned a `truthfulness` value (0‚Äì1) on spawn. This controls deception odds.

- **Skills**:
  - Accurate (real): 70‚Äì80%
  - Exaggerated: +2 to +6 shown (10‚Äì15%)
  - Faked: Claims 6‚Äì10, actual 0‚Äì3 (5‚Äì10%)

- **Passions**:
  - Honest: matches real
  - Fake: passion icon shown but none exists
  - Disabled: flame shown for disabled skill

- **Traits**:
  - Good: 80% shown
  - Neutral: 60% shown
  - Problematic (e.g. Pyro): 20% shown

- **Addictions**: 50% hidden unless discovered via behavior.

üî® Harmony Targets
PawnCardUtility.DrawSkills: replace real skill with fogged label

TraitUI.DrawTraitRow: show "???" if not yet discovered

SkillRecord.Learn: unlock fog when XP exceeds 300

Reveal helper methods:

RevealSkill(Pawn, SkillDef)

RevealTrait(Pawn, TraitDef)

RevealAddiction(Pawn)


üîî Example Behavior
A pawn joins claiming "Medical: 8". UI shows "Reported: 8 (unconfirmed)".
After a botched surgery and gaining 400 XP, the fog lifts: the pawn has Medical 0.
Player receives a letter: "You've discovered that Kelvin has no medical experience!"

üöß Fog of Pawn ‚Äì Development Roadmap (RimWorld 1.6 only)
A. High-level Milestones
M0 ‚Äì Project scaffold & CI

Git repo, MIT license, About.xml w/ <supportedVersions>1.6</...>

Solution + csproj targeting .NET Framework 4.8

GitHub Actions for matrix build (1.5/1.6), DLL upload

Hello World Harmony patch

M1 ‚Äì Core data layer

CompPawnFog + CompProperties

GameComponent_FogTracker to attach fog to all new pawns on map

truthfulness generator + lie logic

Dev gizmo: "Reveal all fog for this pawn"

‚úÖ DELIVERABLE: Save/load roundtrip works; log prints fog state on join

M2 ‚Äì Skills fog + reveal

Patch PawnCardUtility.DrawSkills

Show fake values + passion icons

Patch SkillRecord.Learn to unlock after 300 XP

Add popup letter/message when skill is revealed

‚úÖ DELIVERABLE: Player can observe pawn and see real values unlock

M3 ‚Äì Trait concealment

Adopt the same **swap-during-draw** pattern used for skills: immediately before traits are drawn, temporarily remove or rename any unrevealed traits, then restore the real list in a Postfix. No transpile required.

Targets (1.6 UI):
  ‚Ä¢ `TraitUI.DrawTraitRow` or whichever helper renders trait rows.
  ‚Ä¢ Fallback: temporarily clear `pawn.story.traits.allTraits` inside `ITab_Pawn_Character.FillTab` Prefix.

Reveal triggers: mental breaks, violent acts, fire-starting, time passed.

‚úÖ DELIVERABLE: Traits hidden with "???" and gradually unlocked ‚Äì approach resilient to UI mods.

M4 ‚Äì Integrate with genes

Ensure that Trait concealment considers genes that edits skills and passion


M5 ‚Äì Addictions & Health

Mask addictions in Health tab until triggered

Optional: full health fog toggle

‚úÖ DELIVERABLE: Drug users shock player after first dose

M6 ‚Äì Mod Settings

Create ModSettings_FogOfPawn

Exposed values:

% Truthful / Exaggerated / Faked

XP to reveal

Toggles: fog skills / traits / addictions

Dev reveal button

‚úÖ DELIVERABLE: All settings persist and take effect immediately

M7 ‚Äì Polish & Release

Localized string keys

Trait "???" icon, fake passion sprite

Test with UI mods (RIMHUD, Character Editor)

Publish to GitHub + Steam Workshop

B. Cross-cutting Concerns
Version gating via #if RW15 / #if RW16 (put in Compat/)

All patches via Harmony Prefix/Postfix (avoid transpile unless necessary)

Fail-safe: Log + skip failing patch rather than crash mod

External mod support: Expose C# API: FogAPI.IsSkillFogged(Pawn, SkillDef) etc.

üéâ You are now ready to build a structured, scalable fog-of-war system for RimWorld pawns ‚Äî blending mechanics and storytelling.


Progress r√©sum√© (Status: late-M3)

‚úîÔ∏è  What‚Äôs fully implemented
‚Ä¢ Foundation (M0-M1) ‚Äì project scaffold, Harmony bootstrap, CI build script.
‚Ä¢ CompPawnFog side-car with save/load round-trip.
‚Ä¢ Skill fog layer (M2) ‚Äì swap-during-draw; compatible with other UI mods.
‚Ä¢ Settings UI ‚Äì sliders/toggles hot-apply.
‚Ä¢ Tiered deception system v2 (Truthful / Slight / Scammer / Sleeper) driven by global "Lie Frequency".
‚Ä¢ Social-interaction & passive-time reveal channels.
‚Ä¢ GrammarResolver flavour messages for reveals.
‚Ä¢ Dev gizmos ‚Äì print profile, tier setters (with pawn-value validation), XP boost.
‚Ä¢ Logging wrapper (`FogLog`) with REFLECT / FAIL / PROFILE tags.

üü°  In progress / needs polish
‚Ä¢ Trait concealment patch (swap-during-draw) ‚Äì code not started.
‚Ä¢ Narrative hooks:  
   ‚Äì `OnScammerRemoved` (+mood thought).  
   ‚Äì `OnSleeperFullyRevealed` (blue letter).
‚Ä¢ Addictions & Genes fog design.

üîú  Immediate next tasks

   ‚Ä¢ Prefix/Postfix mask on `TraitUI.DrawTraitRow` (fallback ITab).  
   ‚Ä¢ Reveal triggers: mental break, fire starting, time.  
   ‚Ä¢ "Unknown Trait" icon/tooltip.

3. Settings polish ‚Äì max altered skills slider localisation text, optional notification style.

üõ£Ô∏è  Upcoming milestones
‚Ä¢ M5 ‚Äì Addictions & Health fog.  
‚Ä¢ M6 ‚Äì advanced settings fold-out, localisation pass.
